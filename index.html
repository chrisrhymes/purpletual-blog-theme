<p>This is a demo site for the <a href="https://github.com/chrisrhymes/purpletual-blog-theme">Purpletual Blog Theme</a>. The name I wanted to use was already taken so I decided on this instead as it's a mix of purple and purpetual.</p>

<p>This Jekyll theme is built using Tailwind CSS as an experiment to see what it can do.</p>

<p>This is a fork from <a href="https://github.com/oddstronaut/jekyll-starter-tailwind">Jekyll Starter Tailwind</a> and is designed to be easily deployed to Netlify</p>
